Grading

As you complete Phase 1 of the boot camp and prepare for your JavaScript project review, it’s important to understand how your project will be graded. Below is an outline to help you know what to expect during the grading process:

Project Submission

* Submission Deadline: Ensure your project repo link is submitted before your scheduled review time.
* Project Repository: Your repository should be well-organized, including a README file that provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and any other relevant information.

Code Review Preparation

* Familiarity with Requirements: Review the project requirements and ensure your project meets all outlined criteria.
* Documentation: Ensure your code is well-documented and your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

Code Review Session

* Project Walkthrough: Be prepared to walk through your code from the execution point to the exit point. You should be able to explain the flow of your application clearly.
* Technical Verbiage: Use correct technical terminology when describing your code. If you are unsure about certain terms, your reviewer will help you reframe your explanations.

Demo and Feedback
* Project Demonstration: You will demo your project, showcasing the key features and functionalities. Be prepared to discuss how you designed and architected these features.
* Code Refactoring: After the demo, your reviewer will address any issues and guide you through refactoring. Pay attention to their suggestions and ask questions if you need clarification.

Grading Criteria

* Functionality: Does your project meet all the requirements? Are all features working as intended?
* Code Quality: Is your code clean, well-structured, and free of obvious bugs? Have you followed best practices?
* Problem-Solving Skills: How well have you integrated JavaScript with external APIs? Have you demonstrated effective debugging and troubleshooting skills?
* Collaboration and Communication: Are you able to explain your work clearly? Have you collaborated effectively with your peers?

Areas of Focus

* JavaScript Knowledge: Be prepared to answer questions about JavaScript terminology and concepts as listed in the project review expectations.
* Feedback Implementation: Show that you can take feedback constructively and apply it to improve your project.

Overall Assessment

Your final grade will reflect your understanding of JavaScript, the quality of your project, your ability to communicate your work, and your responsiveness to feedback.

By following these guidelines and preparing thoroughly, you can ensure a smooth and successful project review process. Good luck!

## Project Review Rubric

### Project Inquiry

* **4:** The student went above and beyond the level of understanding you’d expect at this point in the curriculum.
* **3:** The student clearly and confidently communicated the essence of the concept.
* **2:** The student took a while or didn’t sound confident in their answer but were correct.
* **1:** The student needed help to understand/explain the concept.
* **0:** The student was completely unable to demonstrate understanding, even with help/hints.

### Conceptual Exercises

* **4:** The student fluently and precisely answered all of the questions about the conceptual exercises, demonstrating mastery of the concepts.
* **3:** The student answered most of the questions about the technical exercises correctly with little help.
* **2:** The student answered more than half of the questions with some help and prompting, showing a solid grasp of the core concepts.
* **1:** The student was able to answer some of the questions with prompting but struggled with terminology and correctly identifying behavior.
* **0:** The student was not able to answer conceptual questions about the code in the exercises, even with prompting.

### Live Coding

* **4:** The student quickly and confidently wrote elegant, well-designed code, perhaps using patterns you wouldn’t expect for this review.
* **3:** The student was able to independently write code to solve the problem, generally using patterns you’d expect for this review.
* **2:** The student needed some help and made some mistakes but were able to put together working code, even if it wasn’t using best practices or well-designed.
* **1:** The student had a much harder time writing code than you would expect for this review. They clearly need some revision.
* **0:** The student was unable to write code that made any sense.

### Technical Communication and Soft Skills

* **4:** The student was able to communicate clearly, fluently, accurately, and independently about their project and technical concepts.
* **3:** The student was able to communicate clearly and accurately about their project and technical concepts with only minor help.
* **2:** The student’s communication about their project and technical concepts was effective overall but required some help or had minor errors.
* **1:** The student did not communicate effectively about their project or technical concepts, had significant errors or gaps, or relied heavily on the interviewer for help.
* **0:** The student struggled to communicate about their project and technical concepts, even with help.

Total Points: **16**

### What should you be prepared for in Project Review?

During your project review, be prepared to:

1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. Use the best technical vocabulary you can.
2. Live code. This could be refactoring, adding a new feature, or both.
3. Answer questions about your knowledge of _JavaScript Fundamentals_.

In particular, the JavaScript Fundamentals concepts your reviewer may ask about include:

- variables
- data structures
- functions
- hoisting
- scope
- context
- `this`
- closures
- ES6 syntax
- `let`, `const`
- arrow functions
